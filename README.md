# Stochastic Gradient Descent from Scratch

This project demonstrates the implementation of **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)** from scratch using Python. SGD is a widely used optimization algorithm in machine learning, particularly useful for training linear models and neural networks.

## 🚀 Features

- Implemented using only basic Python and NumPy
- Linear regression using stochastic gradient descent
- Clear code structure with comments
- Easy to understand for beginners learning optimization
